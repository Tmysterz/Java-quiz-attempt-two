* Description 
In this program I created a dynamic multiple choice question quiz that is about javascript topics. In this application there are 4 total questions. Every question that is answered incorrect a penalty of 10 seconds will be enforced onto the timer. When ever the user clicks the start button a question is presented and after you select a answer choice the next question is presented. The end of the quiz includes a high scores section that you can input your initials to save your high score.
